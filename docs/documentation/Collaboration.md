# Sharing your Vehicles and Collaborating with Other Users

LubeLogger allows you to collaborate on vehicles so that more than one user can add or edit records on a vehicle.

To share a vehicle, simply navigate into the Vehicle's Dashboard, and look to the bottom left

Click on the little blue button with a User Add icon and you will be prompted to enter the user's username

**Note:** The username is case sensitive and the user must exist in the system.

Once you have added the user, their username will then show up in the list of Collaborators

Now the user can view and edit the vehicle as well:
