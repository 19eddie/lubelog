# Notes

The Notes tab contains important notes about your vehicle.

## Markdown Parsing
Markdown formatting is supported across all Notes fields in the app. The underlying markdown parser is [Drawdown](https://github.com/adamvleggett/drawdown). To toggle between edit and preview mode, simply click on the markdown icon next to the "Notes" label.

There is also a setting, that when enabled, will automatically load all notes in Markdown form when viewing existing records. The only exception is when an existing record has an empty notes field.

## Pinned Notes
Notes can be pinned by checking the "Pinned" switch when creating or editing a note.

Pinned Notes will always show up at the very top of the list.

On non-touchscreen devices, pinned notes can be viewed when the user hovers over the vehicle tile in the garage. On mobile, the user have to hold down on the garage tile in order for the pinned notes to show up.
