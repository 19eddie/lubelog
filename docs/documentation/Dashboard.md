# Dashboard

The Dashboard is where you get an overview of your vehicle. It is the default tab that the user will see when they click into a vehicle and it is also the only tab that cannot be hidden.

The Dashboard includes the following data:
- Expenses By Type By Year/All Time(Top-Left)
- Total Expenses By Month By Year/All Time(Top-Center)
- Reminders by current date or future date(Top-Right)
- Collaborators(Bottom-Left), see [[Adding Collaborators|Vehicle Management#adding-a-collaborator]]
- Fuel Mileage By Month By Year/All Time(Bottom-Center)
- Vehicle Maintenance Report Generator(Bottom-Right)

## Filtering Data by Year
The year dropdown above the pie chart(top-left) allows the user to filter the aggregated data by year. The year selections are populated by retrieving all years between the year of the oldest record and the current year. If the oldest record is less than 5 years old, the selections will still be populated by the last 5 years.

Note: Changing the selected year will automatically refresh the Expenses by Type Pie Chart, the Total Expenses by Month and the Fuel Mileage By Month Bar Charts.

## Vehicle Maintenance Report
The Vehicle Maintainence Report Generator is a button that will generate a consolidated report of all work performed on the vehicle. For performance reasons, this report is designed to be printed as soon as it is generated. You can either choose to print it to paper or PDF.

Once you have made your selection, a zip file will be created and downloaded onto your computer. This zip file contains all of the attachments and are named in chronological order(i.e.: the oldest attachment will be named 0 and the second oldest attachment 1, 2...)
