# Vehicle Management

## Adding a Vehicle
To add a vehicle, simply click on the green "+" button in the "Garage" tab. A dialog will then prompt you for the following details of the vehicle you wish to add: Year, Make, Model, License Plate, and optionally, a picture of the vehicle. If it's an Electric Vehicle, you should check the "Electric Vehicle" switch. This ensures that "fuel" economy is measured in kWh instead of gallons or liters.

Once you're done, click "Add New Vehicle" and the vehicle will now be visible in the Garage Tab.

### Sorting Vehicles
To sort vehicles by Year, simply right click on the Garage tab while the tab is selected.

On mobile, make sure the Garage tab is selected and long hold on the garage menu button.

## Editing a Vehicle
To edit an existing vehicle, go into the vehicle details by clicking on the vehicle tile in the Garage. If you're on a computer/tablet, there will be a yellow button on the top right of the screen, click it to edit details regarding the vehicle.

To delete an existing vehicle, click on the "Manage Vehicle" dropdown and select "Delete Vehicle". You will then be prompted for confirmation before the vehicle is deleted. Once the vehicle is deleted, you will be redirected back to the Garage.

## Adding a Collaborator
If more than one individual logs records to your vehicle(e.g.: spouse, employee, etc) and they have their own user account with LubeLogger, you can add them as a collaborator.

To add new collaborator, simply navigate to the Dashboard tab in the vehicle details view and look to the bottom right:

Click on the blue Add User icon on the top left of the Collaborators panel and you will be prompted to type in their username, note that a user with that username must exist in the system or you will get an error.

Once you have added them as a collaborator, their name will now show up in the Collaborators list, and you will also be given the option to remove them.

Once this is done, you should have the new collaborator refresh their browser and they should be able to see the vehicle in their Garage.
