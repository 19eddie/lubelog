               Authentication is disabled by default in LubeLogger. To enable authentication, navigate to the "Settings" tab and check "Enable Authentication".<br>
               A dialog will pop up prompting you to enter a Username and Password. These are the credentials for the "Root User", i.e.: the SuperUser.<br>
               Once you have set up your credentials, the app will you out to a Login screen, login using the credentials you just created.<br>
               There will now be a dropdown tab to the right of "Settings", click on it and you will see two options: "Admin Panel" and "Logout"
            </p>
            <span class="lead">Multiple Users</span>
            <p>
                Before you get started, it is highly recommended that you set up a SMTP server(though not required) as it will greatly automate the User's Registration Process.<br>
                If you have an SMTP server, you can set it up in LubeLogger using the variables within <code>.env</code><br>
                To set up new users, you must first have their email address on hand as the registration process is invite-only by design.<br>
                Navigate to the "Admin Panel" and select "Generate New Token". A dialog will prompt you to enter the email address of the user.<br>
                If you have SMTP set up, there will be a switch right next to the button that says "Auto Notify(via Email)", this switch is only enabled with valid SMTP settings.<br>
                Enter the user's email address, and a new token will be generated and emailed to them if SMTP is set up, otherwise you will have to send it to them manually.<br>
                The user can then navigate to your LubeLogger instance, click the "Register" link under the "Login" button and type in their details including the token they received.<br>
                Note: It is important that their email address matches the email address the token is issued to, otherwise they will receive an Invalid Token error.<br>
                Once the user has registered their account, they will then be able to login and start adding their own vehicles<br>
